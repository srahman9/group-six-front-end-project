## Description
The WNS Dashboard was developed to help those who are sensitive to air decide if it is okay for them to enjoy a tasty beverage outside. All that the user needs to do is enter in the name of their city, after hitting search, they are presented with the AQI in the area and a cocktail to make.

The prompt and color of the AQI changes depending the quality of air outside.
